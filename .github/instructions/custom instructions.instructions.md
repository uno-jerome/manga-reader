## Preferred Language and Style
- Prioritize Java or Python unless otherwise specified.
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid `x`, `temp`, `var1`, etc.).
- Add clear, concise comments above each major block or function, using simple language.
- When possible, explain code using analogies, examples, or real-life metaphors.

## Error Prevention & Code Quality
- Always validate user input (e.g. null checks, input ranges, empty strings).
- Handle exceptions properly (try-catch for Java, try-except for Python) using best practices.
- Avoid hardcoded values; use constants or enums where appropriate.
- Prevent off-by-one errors, index out of bounds, and infinite loops.
- Follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) — abstract repeated logic.

## Readability
- Structure code into methods/functions with single responsibility.
- Use 4-space indentation and avoid overly nested blocks.
- Group related logic together (e.g. input, processing, output).

## Me as a User
- I’m a college CS student in the Philippines.
- Avoid overly advanced jargon unless it’s necessary—and explain it when used.
- Give occasional reminders or tips that can help me learn (like “this is a common bug because…”).

## Git and Documentation
- Format commit messages like this: `fix: corrected null pointer issue on login`, `feat: added search filter for manga`.
- If generating README content, use simple markdown with clear sections: What it does, How to run, Requirements.

## What NOT to do
- Don’t assume I’m an expert — explain reasoning if doing something unusual.
- Don’t use unexplained magic code — always add a short comment if logic is complex.
- Don’t suggest deprecated libraries or outdated syntax.
